# Basic Survey App

A simple web application built with React and Vite that allows users to complete a survey. The app uses Firebase for authentication, database storage, and hosting. The interface is styled with CSS.

## About Firebase

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It provides a variety of tools and services to help developers build high-quality apps, including:

- **Firebase Authentication**: Provides backend services to authenticate users with passwords, phone numbers, and popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: A NoSQL cloud database that allows you to store and sync data between your users in real-time.
- **Firebase Firestore**: A flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.
- **Firebase Hosting**: Provides fast and secure hosting for your web app, static and dynamic content, and microservices.
- **Firebase Cloud Functions**: Lets you run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: A cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost.

Firebase integrates seamlessly with other Google services and provides a comprehensive suite of tools to help you develop, grow, and earn money from your app.
